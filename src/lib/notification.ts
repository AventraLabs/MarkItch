 *
 * Phase 36: also sends an actual push (not just the in-app bell) to
 * whichever of a recipient's devices are subscribed — the VAPID
 * infrastructure (src/lib/push.ts) existed since Phase 12 but nothing ever
 * called it, so nobody's phone ever actually buzzed for anything, "Duell

 * that device never subscribed, and no-ops entirely when VAPID keys aren't
 * configured — never blocks the in-app notification either way.
