// Phase 41: every route here was fully server-rendered with no
// `loading.tsx` anywhere in the app — Next.js showed *nothing* during a
// navigation until the destination page's data finished loading, which on
// a live deployment (especially inside the Capacitor WKWebView) reads as
// "did my tap even register?" (Luca: "wieso lagged alles so... es dauert
// paar Sekunden bis man auf dem Tab dann ist"). A `loading.tsx` per route
// segment shows this immediately on navigation while the real page streams
// in behind it — doesn't make the data faster, but the app now visibly
// reacts to every tap instantly instead of appearing frozen.

/**
 * Phase 43: found a real, reproducible bug behind Luca's "lädt nur, erst
 * beim zweiten Klick geht's" reports — a client-side (Link/router) soft
 * navigation to a page can get stuck showing this component *forever*,
 * even though the exact same URL loads instantly and correctly as a hard
 * reload every single time (verified directly: the RSC fetch for the
 * click-triggered navigation shows 200 in the network panel but its body
 * never finishes streaming, while a fresh `navigate` to the identical URL
 * renders immediately). That points at a client-side router/prefetch-cache
 * issue in this Next.js version, not at slow data — the server side was
 * already ruled out. Rather than chase that framework internal further,
 * this is the pragmatic fix: if this "Lädt…" screen is still showing after
 * a few seconds, something is stuck, not just slow — force a real reload
 * of wherever the URL bar already points (the router updates the URL
 * immediately on navigation, before the content is ready), which our own
 * testing showed always works. Same philosophy as error.tsx: doesn't fix
 * the underlying framework quirk, turns "frozen forever" into "unstuck in
 * a few seconds" instead.
